# THE GAME
**WHERE_DO_I_PUT_THIS_-TETRIS-**  
*A recreation of Tetris, for an educational journey into Software Development.*

In 1984, a Russian legend, Alexey Pajitnov, created Tetris.  
*(just realised that that's more than 40 years ago as of 2025).*  

The history of the game's distribution is a complex and messy one.  

With companies fighting legal battles for rights, agents working for Nintendo discovering "loopholes" for licensing, and to Pajitnov eventually gaining his own rights to the game when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1996.  

The Tetris lore is so deep, Tetris has an official movie. *"Tetris is a 2023 biographical thriller film based on true events around the race to license and patent the video game Tetris from Russia in the late 1980s during the Cold War." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(film)*

The game has come a long way and today, major international Tetris tournaments are currently being held, and many versions and spinoffs of the game have already been released.  

For me, Tetris brings me peace. As I get engrossed and enter the flow state mid game, everything else in the room disappears.  

There have been studies and experiments carried out, with results showing that Tetris actually has therapeutic abilities.  
PTSD prevention, trauma treatment, imrpoving brain plasticity, and no wonder I feel good after a long session of Tetris.

Tetris has kept me company since young. Daily commute to school and back *(Tetris Mobile)*, downtime in the military with my buddies *(Puyo-puyo Tetris)*, introducing it to friends and family, and watching them get better over time (TetrisFriends, Tetr.io), being gifted a Nintendo Switch and spending more than half the time with it playing *Tetris 99*.

So when I was told our project was to create a web browser game, I knew immediately what I was going to build.
